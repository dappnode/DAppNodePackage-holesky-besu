# Important Info

You can limit the resource usage (eg. RAM) in BESU_OPTS in the Advanced Configuration. Just pass it the standard JVM memory arguments.

Looks like this:

```
-Xms8G -Xmx12G
```

This package by default uses the newer BONSAI storage structure. You can switch it to the older FOREST one in the Settings. Does require a resync and potentially a volume removal.
