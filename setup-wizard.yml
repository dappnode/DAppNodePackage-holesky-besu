      Besu can use one of two storage formats, Forest of Tries or Bonsai Tries. 


      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Data-Storage-Formats). 


      Default storage format is BONSAI (it requires less storage space and is faster).

  - title: Sync Mode
    id: sync_mode
    description: >-
      Besu can use one of three sync modes, FULL (slow, archive node), FAST (fast, full node), SNAP (faster and works with BONSAI), and CHECKPOINT (Fastest, and smallest on disk works with BONSAI. Cannot serve full chain history to peers).

      Default sync mode is CHECKPOINT.
