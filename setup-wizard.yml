      Besu can use one of two storage formats, Forest of Tries or Bonsai Tries. 


      You can read about the differences [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Concepts/Data-Storage-Formats). 


      Default storage format is BONSAI (it requires less storage space and is faster).

    description: >-
      Besu can use one of three sync modes, FULL (slow, archive node), FAST (fast, full node), X_SNAP (faster, experimental and works with BONSAI), and X_CHECKPOINT (Fastest, and latest sync method works with BONSAI).

      Default sync mode is X_CHECKPOINT.
